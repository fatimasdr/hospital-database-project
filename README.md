# hospital-database-project
 A university project to design and implement a hospital database. Includes concept design, database schema, ER diagram, and SQL code for creating and populating the system.

# 🏥 Hospital Database Project

This project was created as part of my university coursework to demonstrate the process of designing and implementing a relational database system for a hospital.

## 📌 Project Components

1. **📄 Project Concept**  
   - Description of hospital requirements and system scope (patients, doctors, appointments, billing, etc.)

2. **🗂️ Database Schema**  
   - Tables, attributes, data types, and relationships.

3. **📊 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
   - Visual representation of entities and their relationships.

4. **💾 SQL Code**  
   - SQL statements to create the database, define tables, and insert sample data.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- MySQL
- Draw.io / Lucidchart (for ERD)

## 📁 Files

- `Project_Concept.pdf` — System overview and description  
- `Database_Schema.pdf` — Table design and attributes  
- `ERD.png` — Entity Relationship Diagram  
- `hospital_db.sql` — SQL code to create and populate the database

## 🎓 Purpose

This project demonstrates database design principles, normalization, and practical use of SQL to create a healthcare management database system.
